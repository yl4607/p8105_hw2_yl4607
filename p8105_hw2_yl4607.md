## Problem 1

**Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset**

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )      
```

**Read preciptation data for 2018 and 2017**

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

**Combine annual precipitation**

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df =
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2018     1  0.94 January   
    ##  2  2018     2  4.8  February  
    ##  3  2018     3  2.69 March     
    ##  4  2018     4  4.69 April     
    ##  5  2018     5  9.27 May       
    ##  6  2018     6  4.77 June      
    ##  7  2018     7 10.2  July      
    ##  8  2018     8  6.45 August    
    ##  9  2018     9 10.5  September 
    ## 10  2018    10  2.12 October   
    ## # … with 14 more rows

This dataset contains information from the Mr.Trashwheel trash collector
in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the trashwheel
collects that trash, and stores it iin a dumpster. The dataset contains
information on year, month, and trash collected, include some specific
kinds of trash. There are a total 344 rows in our final dataset. From
the dataset, we can know that there are 530 sports balls among the total
174.84 tons of trash being collected in 2017.

Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. According to
the data, the total precipitation in 2017 was 70.33, and the total
precipitatioh in 2018 was also 70.33.

## Problem 2

**Read the NYC Transit Entrance and Exit dataset**

``` r
transit_df = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, contains("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, 'YES' = TRUE, 'NO' = FALSE)) %>% 
  mutate(route8 = as.factor(route8)) %>% 
  mutate(route9 = as.factor(route9)) %>% 
  mutate(route10 = as.factor(route10)) %>% 
  mutate(route11 = as.factor(route11))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

The current dataset contains 19 variables: line, station, name, station
latitude, station longitude, routes served (1 - 11), entry, vending,
entrance type, and ADA compliance. I have cleaned the variable names to
let the names only consist "\_", numbers, and letters. I have also
converted the entry variable from character to a logical variable and
the route variables to factor variables. The dimension for this dataset
is 1868 rowa x 19 columns. I don’t think these data are tidy enough,
since I find the dataset is hard to read with a lot of NA values present
in the route columns.

There are 684 distinct stations. 468stations are ADA compliant. There
are 183 station entrances/exits without vending allow entrance, which is
9.7965739% of the total stations.

**Create distinct variables: route number and route name**

``` r
transit_df_tidy = 
  transit_df %>% 
    pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_name") %>% 
  drop_na()
```

There are 91 distinct stations serve the A train. Among the distinct
stations that serve A train, 34 stations are ADA compliant, and among
all the stations that serve A train, 107 stations are ADA compliant.
